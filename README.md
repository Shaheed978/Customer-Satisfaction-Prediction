# Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction

In this project, I developed a predictive model using public employee salary data from San Francisco to estimate total compensation, including benefits, based on features like base pay, overtime pay, and job title. After cleaning the data by converting salary components to numeric and imputing missing values, I used Label Encoding to handle high-cardinality categorical features such as job titles. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize salary distributions and trends, identifying insights such as the strong correlation between base pay and overall compensation. I then built and trained a Linear Regression model, evaluating it with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared, and found that the model performed well in predicting total compensation. The project demonstrated the importance of benefits and job roles in employee compensation and provided actionable insights for salary structure analysis.
